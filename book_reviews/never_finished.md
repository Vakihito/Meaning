## Never Finished

"Never Finished" is an inspiring narrative about a boy who endured a miserable and abusive childhood and transformed himself into someone extraordinary through sheer hard work and relentless discipline. The central message of the book is that even in the worst circumstances, if you take responsibility for your failures, you can transcend your limitations and become more than you ever imagined.
David Goggins' life is a testament to the human spirit's boundless potential. His journey is about striving to become the person he was meant to be by pushing his limits every single day.

He shows us that the human spirit, when fully harnessed, is capable of incredible feats.
“You are never done, don’t stop when you’re tired, stop when you are done !” - David Goggins

While I liked this book, I think “Can’t hurt me” is the better one.
