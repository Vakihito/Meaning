# Meaning of Life - 1

In the last few years,I have been thinking a lot about the question, "What is the meaning of life?". Although I haven't found a definitive answer, I have come across some valuable ideas that are helping me along the way.


While thinking what could the answer be, I began by searching for the worst-case scenarios where life seems to lose its meaning. The logic being that, if it works in the worst case, it would probably work in all the others. And then I found a great idea expressed by Viktor Frankl, who was a prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, arguably one of the worst scenarios imaginable. During his imprisonment, Frankl was developing his PhD thesis and trying to determine what could be the answer to the meaning of life.

One of the first things Frankl learned was that a person could only survive in a concentration camp as long as they had a meaning for their life. The moment they lost this sense of purpose, they would perish within days. In his book, Frankl frequently quoted Nietzsche: “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”, trying to explain how a person could deal with such horrible conditions. 

Some years later, after getting out of the camp Vicktor developed Logotherapy,  a form of therapy that focuses on finding the meaning of life. And to that, he answered that the meaning resides in trying to answer in the best way possible the questions that life throws at you. 

In this same perspective, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who survived Soviet concentration camps, wrote that the best way to live is to honestly strive to make things better. He warned that acting in a pathological manner not only corrupts oneself but also pathologizes the society. Solzhenitsyn believed that the moral decay of individuals leads to the decay of society as a whole. Therefore, one should always try to live and act in the best way possible. 

Together, they suggest that meaning is not something to be discovered in abstract philosophical musings but is found in the everyday actions and decisions we make. Both stories told through the life of  Frankl and Solzhenitsyn exemplify that no matter what the conditions of life are, there is a moral obligation of making the best of it. 

## The best critic 


While all these perspectives are great and remove the possibilities of acting in a way that distances you from what you could be, this still does not answer the main question … 

Some time ago Nietzsche declared the “death of God”, while this phrase is usually found in public bathrooms followed by the quotes “Nietzsche is dead - God”, it was more like a scream things that would follow. This was a profound and unsettling proclamation reflecting his horror at the implications of a world without the traditional moral and metaphysical frameworks provided by religion.

As Nietzche said : “ “Whither is God?” he cried; “I will tell you. We have killed him—you and I. All of us are his murderers. Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? …” 

The declaration in tears of the death of God, meaning that mankind stopped believing that religion was the core principles of his life, the following sentences indicate that loss of these principles would lead mankind without a direction in life. In Nietzsche's view, the loss of a central, unifying religious belief system would challenge the foundations of morality and purpose, potentially leading to nihilism—a state in which life appears to lack intrinsic value or meaning. Without principles there would be no meaning. 

Nietzsche's concern was that without a divine or absolute source of meaning, individuals and societies might struggle to find purpose and ethical direction. This existential crisis could result in a fragmentation of values and a sense of disorientation. His writings explored how humanity might confront and navigate this crisis, proposing that new values and meanings must be created to replace those that had been lost.

In response to the "death of God," Nietzsche argued that individuals would need to create their own principles and values to guide their lives and provide meaning and purpose. He believed that, in the absence of traditional religious frameworks, people would essentially become their own creators of meaning. This idea reflects Nietzsche's vision of the Übermensch, or "Overman," who transcends conventional norms and creates new values and goals.

In this context, the "death of God" symbolizes not just the end of religious authority but also the opportunity for individuals to shape their own destiny. Nietzsche saw this as a chance for people to take control of their own lives and to build a new belief system based on personal and cultural values rather than inherited doctrines. This process of self-creation and value formation is both a challenge and an opportunity, pushing individuals to confront the complexities of existence and to define their own purpose.

In Genesis 32, the story of Jacob wrestling with God provides a profound metaphor for the search for meaning and purpose. Jacob, who later becomes named by God as “Israel”—meaning "He who wrestles with God"—engages in a struggle that symbolizes the deep internal and spiritual conflicts inherent in the quest for understanding.

This narrative suggests that the people chosen by God, the Israelites, are not those who accept everything without question but rather those who engage in a profound struggle with their divine guidance and principles. It reflects the idea that wrestling with one's beliefs, values, and purpose is a crucial aspect of personal growth.

In a similar vein, our modern quest for meaning and purpose mirrors this ancient struggle. Just as Jacob wrestled with God to understand his own path and destiny, we too grapple with our own ideals and the search for purpose in our lives. This ongoing struggle with our values and beliefs can lead us closer to discovering what we are meant to do and how we can live authentically.

We cannot return to an era where belief in God was unchallenged and unquestioned. The advancement of science and the critical examination of our dogmas have exposed numerous gaps and inconsistencies in the principles that once guided us. In the wake of this "death of principles," we are left grappling with the question of meaning in our lives. The traditional frameworks that provided answers and direction have eroded, and as we seek to fill this void, we face the challenge of constructing new sources of meaning and purpose.

But as you probably already noticed it is very hard for someone to define goals and follow as closely as possible, for example we usually define that we will wake up at 5 am, workout, do our best at our jobs, then come back home and study until 10 pm, and do all over again. But after a few weeks we are wasting time watching things on youtube that not only we don’t wanna watch, but also feel worse after watching. If we are not even able to create a set of goals, how could we create an entire belief system ? 

For a long time the great psychologist Carl Jung thought about Nietzche's perspective on becoming the Übermensch. In essence, Jung's point is that while Nietzsche's ideal of the Übermensch is a compelling vision of self-creation and personal meaning, it may be unrealistic to expect individuals to fully achieve this ideal. The complexities of human psychology and the difficulties in consistently adhering to self-defined principles mean that creating and living by a coherent belief system is an ongoing, and often challenging, process.

Jung’s insights suggest that rather than viewing the quest for meaning as a linear journey, it may be more fruitful to approach it as a dynamic and evolving process, where personal growth and self-discovery are integral to finding and maintaining a sense of purpose.

## What could the answer be

If we left the concepts that used to guide us in the past, and we can’t define a meaning to our lives, what should be left ? A meaningless existence ?

You see, when a baby is born, when we hear the show of our favorite bands, when see a person performing to the limits of their abilities, there is just no way that you would ask the meaning of life, because it is as if life were revealing itself right in front of you, you would have to blind to not see the meaning of these moments. 

As Carl Jung pointed out, each person is born with a unique set of characteristics, resulting in varied personalities and values. During childhood, we naturally express a range of interests and inclinations that reflect our authentic selves or at least our potential. These early expressions often hint at who we are or who we might become. 

However, as we grow older, societal expectations and external pressures often lead us to conform to prescribed roles and norms. Following what we are told to do can seem prudent when we are young and inexperienced, as it provides guidance and structure. But as we gain more life experience and understanding, it becomes increasingly important to view life through our own set of values rather than merely adhering to others' expectations.

Your set of experiences, your genes, and the things that build you as a person, will never repeat in the entire universe, so maybe, every person has inherent potential and qualities in which they can excel. The Bible, for instance, reflects this idea in Genesis 1:26 , where it states that humans are created in the image of God. This means that even our old traditions are telling us that each human being has qualities and potential that reflect this divine image. that should be manifested if we act it out. 

Carl Rogers, a prominent humanistic psychologist, emphasized the importance of living authentically by expressing your true self rather than conforming to what you think others want you to be. According to Rogers, real and meaningful relationships are built on authenticity and genuine self-expression. You live the best of your life when you express what is inside you, instead of who you think other people want you to be. The idea being that the only way to create real relations is by being who you are instead of the image of what you wanna be.

So the real question is : what should be the meaning of life for me ?

While all these ideas are a great way to give a hint to the answer, there will never be an answer to me, and I'm still trying to find what my life should be, but as one would expect, it is something that I gotta figure it out for myself … 

You see, if you were to look back into your life, the moments of meaning and the things that you value will show what life is all about, some people are disagreeable and want to will every competition, some people are neurotic and need safety, and some people like you are conscientious and keep thinking if life has any value.

But at the end of the day, the things that you value the most in life are what will guide you, your goals, your values, are the lenses through which you interpret the world. So maybe the meaning is right there in front of your eyes …
